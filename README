Pre-Eden compatible version of random movie script.

Note for skinners:

The script will always ask users if they want to restrict selection to unwatched movies

There are various parameters that can be passed
1) Calling the script without any parameters will just ask about unwatched movies
2) filterGenres=True - As well as the unwatched prompt, the user is asked which genre they want to watch
3) promptUser=True - Asks the user about unwatched movies and then whether they want to filter by genre (and provides the genre selection dialog)

Note 2) takes precedence over 3)
